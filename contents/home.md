I am a Robot Learning Engineer focused on enabling generalizable dexterous manipulation across diverse humanoid robot embodiments (arms/hands), tasks and natural human instructions.

Previously, I studied the Elite Master of Science program in Neural Engineering at the [School of Computation, Information and Technology](https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/home/) of the Technical University of Munich (TUM) where I was mentored by [Prof. Gordon Cheng](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/cheng-gordon). My thesis, *"Neural Feature Fields for Language-Based Dexterous Robotic Manipulation,"* focused on language based dexterous grasping and was done at TUM and [Agile Robots SE](https://www.agile-robots.com/en/). This work was supervised by [Qian Feng](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/air/people/qian-feng-msc/) and [Prof. Alois C. Knoll](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/air/people/prof-dr-ing-habil-alois-knoll/), with co-advisorship from [Jianxiang Feng](https://jianxiangfeng.github.io/).

#### Expertise

In general, my work combines visual, tactile, proprioceptive and semantic understanding of the real world with Deep Learning to allow robots to perform dexterous manipulation based on human instructions.

I have developed deep foundation models for generative robotic grasping trained on massive-scale synthetic datasets from simulation. Then integrated them with LLMs and VLMs for prompt based one-shot grasping.

I have also combined imitation learning with dexterous grasp optimization from 3D vision-language features, to enable language and demonstration driven few-shot grasping.

In addition, I have applied deep reinforcement learning to train in-hand manipulation policies.

My expertise further includes Deep Learning based object detection, instance segmentation, 3D pose estimation and scene reconstruction; on the robotics side, I specialize in large scale robotic simulators, sim-to-real transfer, AI model deployment, robot agent control, teleoperation and dexterous hand control. 

My goal is to contribute to a world with safe, friendly and intelligent robots among us.
