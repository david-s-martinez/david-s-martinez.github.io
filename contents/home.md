I am a dedicated R&D engineer with expertise at the intersection of AI, biomedical technology, and intelligent robotics. I leverage these skills to engineer solutions for Medicine and Industry 4.0, driven by a passion for advancing AI to improve medical outcomes and industrial processes. 

As a student in the Elite Master’s program in Neuroengineering at the [School of Computation, Information and Technology](https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/home/) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), I am mentored by [Prof. Gordon Cheng](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/cheng-gordon). My current research focuses on my thesis, *"Neural Feature Fields for Language-Based Dexterous Robotic Manipulation,"* a groundbreaking collaboration between TUM and [Agile Robots SE](https://www.agile-robots.com/en/). This work is supervised by [Qian Feng](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/air/people/qian-feng-msc/) and [Prof. Alois C. Knoll](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/air/people/prof-dr-ing-habil-alois-knoll/), with co-advisorship from [Jianxiang Feng](https://jianxiangfeng.github.io/).
