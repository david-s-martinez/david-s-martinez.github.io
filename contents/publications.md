<!-- 1. **DexGANGrasp: Dexterous Generative Adversarial Grasping Synthesis for Task-Oriented Manipulation**  
   *Associated with Agile Robots SE*  
   DexGANGrasp is an AI model that uses conditional GANs (cGANs) to generate and evaluate robot grasps, achieving higher success rates than previous methods. By incorporating LLMs and VLMs through DexAfford-Prompt, it enables task-oriented grasping for complex, real-world scenarios.

        <p>The exoskeleton assists arm and wrist movements with both position and force control, and uses an "intention detection algorithm" to predict the user's desired motions. This allows for more natural and responsive assistance, which was evaluated by measuring muscle activity and tracking the accuracy of executed movements.</p>
